            <h2>What is MarketVista?</h2>
            <p>MarketVista is your premier single-underlying derivatives visualization software. Based entirely in your browser, MarketVista adopts an innovative approach to planning your options positions. By viewing projected P/L based on underlying price and volatility, you are able to make more informed decisions. Standard software does not allow you to visually grasp the effect of implied volatility on your position -- MarketVista does. Your brokerage platform does not visually display time decay at projected IV and price points -- MarketVista does.</p>
            <p>MarketVista is also an excellent educational tool. Students can visualize the interaction between the input factors and projected P/L, rather than memorizing a table of relationships. MarketVista visually color-codes greeks as the user moves the cursor across the screen, allowing students to gain a grasp of their meaning and relationships over time. </p>
            <p>Let your portfolio take advantage of MarketVista's compelling visual approach to profitability simulation. MarketVista is available right here online for FREE, accessible from your compatible web browser, with no download required. </p>
